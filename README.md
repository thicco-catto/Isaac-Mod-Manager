# Isaac-Mod-Manager

Ever wanted to have the commodity of mod collections but without having to download mods? Or maybe you're a developer who has to manually activate and deactivate all their mods when testing your own? If that's the case, the Isaac Mod Manager is the solution you've been waiting your whole life for!

## How to use
To run the application simply run (double-click) the `IsaacModManager.exe` file.

The UI is quite simple. Two boxes that contain a list of mods. The left one has all the inactive mods, while the right one has all the active ones.

To move mods over simply double click them, select them and press the arrows, or even click the double arrow buttons to move all the mods from one side to the other. Once you're happy with the changes, just press the big and shiny `Apply` button.

Note that this won't work while the game is running, unless you go to the mods page and press tab twice, which will make the game reload all mods.

If upon opening the app no mods show up, you may need to switch the mods folder. To do this go to `File > Change Mods Path` and choose whatever folder contains your Isaac mods.

## Saving mod collections

If you plan on switching mods frequently, you can easily export your current mod set up to a file clicking `File > Export`. To load a mod collection, all you need to do is click `File > Load` and select the `.imc` file you want to load. This way you can even share mod collections with your friends and family!!

## TODO

    * Actually saving settings
    * Showing missing mods from collection when loading
    * Showing steam links for steam mods
    * Add more platform support
